To start with GCP, the first thing to do is to create an account. 
1. Sign in to your Google Account
2. Go to https://cloud.google.com/
You're gonna need a Credit/Debit card that it's gonna be used for recurring payments.
For the first year / USD 300, you won't be charged anything. Once your trial is over, you'll be asked to upgrade.
3. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/ and check if your *Billing* is activated.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** If you're using the trial and you're using it for learning purposes, remember to deactivate the billing after you complete a test / tutorial / experiment. This way your account will last longer.
